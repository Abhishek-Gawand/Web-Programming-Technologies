            It is rightly said that being disciplined is essential in life. When a person leads a
disciplined life, they set an easy path to success. They will develop an approach to
happiness and a beautiful future ahead. Being disciplined is the practice of having a
scheduled daily routine which helps an individual to be punctual and hard-working.
An individual is taught what being disciplined means from the time they are young.
Even though discipline takes a lot of effort, the advantages of a disciplined life
make it a worthwhile endeavour.
